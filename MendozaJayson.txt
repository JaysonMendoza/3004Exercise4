NOTES:
	Using datastructures in the jdk is not thread safe and a concurrency issue
occured when the PBS class attempted to unsubscribe while the Subject is still 
iterating over observers. Since the professor wants simplicity I opted to copy
the observer list before iterating which would only work in our simple case.

Alternativly I could have made the class fully thread safe and converted it to use
threads and a semaphore.

I did try to use a semaphore at one point but had unexpected results so I abandoned
it instead of investing the time in order to figure out why I had a wait deadlock.
